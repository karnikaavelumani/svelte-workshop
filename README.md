## What is Svelte?

### What is available in the browser?

> Why can't my website be in C++?

The browser does not understand C++ code, but it does understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The browser also understands WebAssembly, which is a way to run C++ code in the browser.

### Describe what Svelte is

Svelte is a template compiler that compiles 3 targets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The web has native languages, currently cannot run C++ code on the web, but the browser does understand the native languages which are HTML, CSS, JS, and web assembly but Svelte only compiles to the 3 targets.

Svelte provides access to the browser's native APIs.

By default, Svelte is just a markup file and is a superset of HTML.

### Why use this over vanilla JS?

Speed. Svelte is remarkably faster than traditional JavaScript frameworks.

### What can I use it for?

Generating the 3 targets (HTML, CSS, JS).

### What is the difference between Svelte vs Sveltekit?

You can use Svelte without Sveltekit, but Sveltekit is a framework that uses Svelte as a compiler.

### What is the difference between Svelte and React?

Svelte is a compiler, React is a library.
